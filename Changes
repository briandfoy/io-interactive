Revision history for IO-Interactive

1.01 - Fri Nov 18 18:36:31 2011
    * Decrease memory use a bit ***:
        1. lazy load Carp.pm only if we're about to croak()
        2. Remove use of version.pm since a decimal will do (made it 1.01 per discussion) - moots rt 50120
        3. Remove the need for Scalar::Util

          *** Baseline RSS 1204,
              Orig RSS 2464 (+1260),
              New RSS 2244 (+1040)

              Technically -220 not a *huge* gain, but the ::Tiny version I'd worked up before this patch had an RSS of 1332 (+128).
              I need to look into that and see if anything else could be done here.

0.05 - Wed Jan 14 22:54:13 2009
	* Happy 2009! There aren't any code changes, but I needed to
	make the version in the Pod match the code version.

	* #24823: is_interactive() and command line arguments

0.03_01 - Sun Aug 24 21:53:11 2008

	line arguments

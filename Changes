Revision history for Perl module IO::Interactive

1.01 - 2011-11-18
    * Decrease memory use a bit ***:
        1. lazy load Carp.pm only if we're about to croak()
        2. Remove use of version.pm since a decimal will do (made it 1.01 per discussion) - moots rt 50120
        3. Remove the need for Scalar::Util

          === Baseline RSS 1204,
              Orig RSS 2464 (+1260),
              New RSS 2244 (+1040)

              Technically -220 not a *huge* gain, but the ::Tiny version I'd worked up before this patch had an RSS of 1332 (+128).
              I need to look into that and see if anything else could be done here.

IO::Interactive version 0.0.2

This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to
develop interactive applications:

    is_interactive() - tests if the process is interactive
    interactive()    - returns a filehandle that prints only if interactive
    busy()           - intercepts interactions whilst executing a block
